# Task-Organizer

This application was made as a term project for CPSC 210 (Object-Oriented Programming).

I decided to create a to-do list application but with my own different features and implementations. The application will allow a user to input their tasks and allow them to mark tasks as complete when finished, or as "important." In addition, I have implemented a feature where the user can either save or load their file, allowing them to keep track of all tasks. This to-do list can be used by anyone as means of staying organized and up-to-date with any assignments or tasks. It can be a useful tool especially for students to sort through assignments from most important to less. I myself am an avid user of to-do list applications. I find them to be extremely useful in staying on top of things. That is why I wanted to create my own implementation of this application, to see what I can come up with.
